# Libft - 42 Barcelona

Description:
Libft is a project that allows you to build your own C library, gathering useful functions that you can use in most of your C projects during the 42 cursus.

Main Features:

- Libc Function Reimplementation: Create customized versions of standard libc functions, such as `ft_strlen`, `ft_memcpy`, among others.
- Additional Functions: Develop functions that are not present in the libc, but are useful for string and memory manipulations.
- List Management: In the bonus section, linked list manipulation is introduced with functions to add, delete, and manage nodes.

General Instructions:

Written in C following the 42 Norm (Norminette).
Includes a Makefile to compile the library.
Global variables are not allowed, and all files must be compiled with the flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`.

Contribution:

This project is a fundamental base in the 42 cursus, and students are encouraged to expand it throughout the year, adding functions as needed in future projects.
